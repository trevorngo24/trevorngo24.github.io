### CPSC 120

* Calculating the Area of a Triangle (Lab 5 Part-1)

    -Lab 5 part-1 was one of my favorite labs because it applied real-world scenarios to coding. In programming this assignment it really clicked to me on how to construct functions and implement them in my code. I also enjoyed this lab because it involved the math thought process of coding.

* Blackjack Game (Lab 6 Part-2)

    -In lab 6 part 2 enjoyed this lab due to it relation to one of my favorite games to play for fun with my friends and family. This assignment required a lot of critical thinking which made it fun and interesting. It changed my way of thinking and problem solving allowing me to brush up on skills that all programmers need to become successful.This increased my knowledge about arguements and correlating it to assignments. Overall, the blackjack game was my favorite to program.

* Philosopher Schedule (Lab 9 part-2)

    -Lab 9 part 2 was interesting to me because we were comparing two strings in a intricate way. They were checking to see if they had the same letter “e” in the same spot. After running the make test, it was enjoyable seeing how each line of code played a significant role in how it affected the outcome.
